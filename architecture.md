# Distributed Multi-Agent System Architecture

## System Overview

The system implements a distributed multi-agent architecture that orchestrates specialized agents powered by various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). The architecture emphasizes scalability, fault tolerance, and real-time collaboration between agents.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Orchestration Layer

#### Agent Manager
- Manages agent lifecycle and coordination
- Implements intelligent task routing based on agent capabilities
- Handles load balancing and fault tolerance
- Monitors agent health and performance

#### Agent Types
- **Task Decomposition Agent**: Breaks down complex tasks into subtasks
- **RAG Agent**: Handles knowledge retrieval and context management
- **Execution Agent**: Performs system operations and tool interactions
- **Oversight Agent**: Monitors outputs for hallucination detection
- **Learning Agent**: Manages continuous system improvement

### 2. Knowledge Management System

#### Vector Store
- Implements efficient embedding storage and retrieval
- Supports dynamic updates and versioning
- Integrates multiple embedding models for different content types

#### Memory Management
- Maintains short-term and long-term memory contexts
- Implements hierarchical memory structures
- Provides context-aware memory retrieval

### 3. Tool Management System

#### Tool Repository
- Dynamic tool registration and discovery
- Tool capability matching and synthesis
- Access control and resource management

#### Tool Categories
- File System Operations
- System Commands
- Web Interactions
- Database Operations
- API Integrations

### 4. Communication Infrastructure

#### Message Bus
- Asynchronous message passing between agents
- Priority-based message routing
- Message persistence and replay capabilities

#### API Layer
- RESTful endpoints for system interaction
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- GraphQL interface for flexible data queries

### 5. Monitoring and Analytics

#### Telemetry System
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and analysis
- Usage patterns and bottleneck detection

#### Learning Pipeline
- Performance data aggregation
- Model fine-tuning pipelines
- Continuous system optimization
